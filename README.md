# Stanford GraphBase in Smalltalk

Knuth's book, "The Stanford GraphBase: A Platform for Combinatorial Computing"
(New York: ACM Press, 1994)
illustrates the cross between two fundational pillars for the 21st-century
computing: combinatorial algorithms and literate programming.
In this repo, we use Knuth's book for experiments in bringing together the
algorithic and visualizational base of Smalltalk-25.
